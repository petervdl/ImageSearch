Found a way to share an image without requiring changes to 3rd party libs or doing FileIO

Updated the Cliff's Note section, to present that approach. I wrote new section "Sharing Remote Images (without explicit file IO)" in https://github.com/thecodepath/android_guides/wiki/Sharing-Content-with-Intents

Looked at adding a 3rd party library, but the docs are not enough for me.
Looked at/worked on StaggeredGridView, and TouchImageView, without good final result
